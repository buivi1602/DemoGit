<p>Resize the browser to see different versions of the picture loading at different viewport sizes.
The browser looks for the first source element where the media query matches the user's current viewport width,
and fetches the image specified in the srcset attribute.</p>

The img element is used to provide backward compatibility for browsers that do not support the picture element, or if none of the source tags matched.
